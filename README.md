# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fun, 25-day-long programming challenge put on every December by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).  Each day until Christmas a new pair of creative programming challenges becomes available.

## About

This repository is my place to keep my solutions to Advent of Code challenges.

## Running the Tests

I organize my solutions to each day's challenges into source and test files, along with an input. To run the tests, see each individual year for instructions based on the particular language that I have used.
